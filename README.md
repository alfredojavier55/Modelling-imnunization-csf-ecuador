## Modelling immunization strategies against Classical swine fever in Ecuador 
This repository contains the code used in the manuscript "Modelling immunization strategies against Classical swine fever in Ecuador" by Acosta et al. The model is written using R language (version 4.2.3).

### Descriptive epidemiology (Descriptive)
The model used oficial information not able to make public.
Reports are available on the link and the RMD files

### Contact and death rates (Contact-death)
Code to calculate beta and gamma rates from epidemic data of 2015

### Modelling simulation 2014-2022 (Sim14-22)
Simulation using the coverage dynamics (montly basis)
The modell is runing with the number of animals as init.cond

### Model simulation 2022-2031 (Sim22-32)
Simulation of future population dynamics

### Sensitivity analysis
We used the 2014-2022 model to fix parameters and obtain 1000 simulations of Monte Carlo simulation, then PRCC
